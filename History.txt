*0.0.2 (pending)*

* Get rid of all heywatch specific Ruby type extension, Hash#method_missing in particular.
  Heywatch don't mess with other lib and with ruby anymore. It now use it's own extended version of Hash and Array. 
  This is fully backward compatible from an api side.
  The only side-effects could be:
   - Test on concrete type on object instead of duck typing (yuk!)
   - You rely on Heywatch Ruby type extension in other part of your code (doh ??)
   But you don't do that hmm, do you ? :)
* Heywatch can now be installed as a Rails Plugin instead of a Gem [al]
* Implement retry on API call [nel]

*0.0.1 (August 8, 2007)*

* First Official Release [Bruno Celeste]
